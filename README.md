Please note that you need to connect the adafruit wave shield to the Arduino Uno.And connect the Speaker to Adafruit wave shield.

Introduction
----
This project can monitor temperature, soil moisture, and light intensity. And the data results are output through an LED lantern and a speaker. The original intention of my project was to make people realize that plants are also alive. Although they cannot express themselves, they are composed of cells just like animals. This project simulates the senses of plants and gives them the ability to speak. My purpose is to make plants communicate with humans like pets.
At the same time, I want to bring happiness to people through this project. We often stay alone and have nobody to communicate with. The feeling of loneliness is horrible. Some people will raise pets to avoid being alone, but this will increase the cost of living. So, I'm going to make a plant pet that can respond to changes in the outside world and maintain constant communication with the user. I hope to ease peopleâ€™s inner loneliness in this way.
